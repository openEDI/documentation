# Annual Technology Baseline (ATB)

## Description

The NREL Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) provides a consistent set of technology and performance data for energy analysis. This dataset was developed with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy's,
Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy.

To inform electric and transportation sector analysis in the United States, each year NREL provides a robust set of modeling input assumptions for energy technologies, and a diverse set of potential electricity generation futures or modeling scenarios (Standard Scenarios).

The ATB is a populated framework to identify technology-specific cost and performance paramters or other investment decision metrics across a range of fuel price conditions as well as site-specific conditions for electric generation technologies at present and with projections through 2050.  

## Model

The purpose of the ATB is to provide CAPEX, O&M, and capacity factor estimates for Base Year and future year projections representing three levels of technical innovation (conservative, moderate, and advanced) for use in electric sector models.

The R&D Only cases are intended to reflect fundamental technology changes over time â€” not short-term market variations in pricing, not changes in interest rates or other project finance elements, and not macroeconomic influences such as commodity price fluctuations. These cases attempt to estimate the potential effects of technology innovation across the renewable electricity generation technologies under comparable levels of probability. This is inherently uncertain.

The Market + Policies Case approximate the costs of electricity generation plants with Independent Power Producer financial terms, covering the energy component of electric system planning and operation. Important items that are not included in these costs limit the validity of comparisons across technologies. The following table summarizes these limitations, identifies other analyses, tools, and data sets that are more complete sources for these items, and suggests applications that are affected by these limitations of the ATB.

See [technical limitations on the ATB website](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/technical_limitations) for more detailed information.

## Directory structure

The CSV files summarize in database-friendly form the capital expenditures, operations expenditures, and capacity factor, as well as the financial assumptions and the levelized cost of energy, for each technology. They are reformatted from the summary section of the spreadsheet, which documents the underlying calculations and data. The same data is also available in the Apache Parquet format.

The files are stored by type and then by year. The file types are parquet and csv. The files can be accessed in the [Department of Energy's Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) in the Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/oedi-data-lake/), or in the [bucket viewer](https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=oedi-data-lake&prefix=ATB%2F).

## Python Examples

```python

import pandas as pd
from pyathena import connect

conn = connect(
    s3_staging_dir='s3://<USER DEFINED STAGING>/', ##user defined staging directory
    region_name='us-west-2',
    work_group='<USER SPECIFIC WORKGROUP>'  ##specify workgroup if exists
)

df = pd.read_sql("SELECT distinct technology, techdetail from oedi_atb.atb_electricity_parquet_2024 where techdetail <> '*' order by technology, techdetail;",conn)
```

OEDI has created a set of tools to facilitate access to open energy data sets, including ATB. Please visit the [open-data-access-tools documentation page](https://openedi.github.io/open-data-access-tools/) for more info. You can find jupyter notebook examples that show how to use the tools in our [examples repository](https://github.com/openEDI/open-data-access-tools/tree/integration/examples)
