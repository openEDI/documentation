# General

## Description

Wind loading is a main contributor to structural design costs of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) collectors, such as heliostats. These structures must resist the mechanical forces generated by turbulent wind. At the same time, the reflector surfaces must exhibit the necessary rigidity to maintain their optimal optical performance in windy conditions.
In 2024-2025, NREL conducted comprehensive field measurements of the atmospheric turbulent wind conditions and the resulting structural wind loads on heliostats at the Crescent Dunes power plant. The measurement set-up included meteorological masts and structural load sensors on three heliostats. Additionally, we commissioned a lidar scanning the solar field along the north-west quadrant.
This data set catalogs the high-resolution data set characterizing the complex flow field and resulting structural loads on heliostats. By providing this first-of-its-kind data set to the CSP community, we aim to enhance the community's understanding of wind-loading experienced by heliostats. This data set will also help design next-generation photovoltaic trackers.

## Measurement setup

The measurement setup is installed within the heliostat field of the Crescent Dunes power tower plant (https://solarpaces.nrel.gov/project/crescent-dunes-solar-energy-project). The plant is located near Tonopah, Nevada, USA, at 38.239N, -117.363E and at 1500 m elevation in a hilly desert environment. The plant’s heliostat field consists of 10347 heliostats surrounding a central tower. NREL’s measurement setup is located at the northwest part of the collector field (outer edge and interior field), targeting prevailing winds from the Northwest, and a lidar is located near the central tower. See the figures below for an overview of the measurement setup, which consists of met masts, a lidar, and load sensors on selected heliostats. Details for each measurement type (met masts, lidar, loads) are summarized in separate documentation for each type. The loads measurements will be added in the future.

## Quality Control Processing

Quality control is implemented using **LiDARGO**:
[https://github.com/StefanoWind/FIEXTA/tree/main/lidargo/lidargo](https://github.com/StefanoWind/FIEXTA/tree/main/lidargo/lidargo)

All parameters used to generate each quality-controlled NetCDF file are recorded in the attributes of the `qc_wind_speed` variable (see “File structure” section).

### Processing Steps

1.	Start time of scan is read from file metadata (header) and used to rename file, along with scan type
2.	Read in all lines from .hpl file and reformat into xarray with dimensions of time and range gate
3.	Add metadata from file header as dataset attributes, including the range gate length, number of range gates, scan type, and pulses per ray
4.	Calculate SNR and radial distance (depends on gate length and gate overlapping)
5.	Bin azimuth and elevation values, then update to bin centers within specified tolerance
6.	Remove data outside prescribed range, radial wind speed (rws), and SNR limits
7.	Perform dynamic filtering based on Beck and Kühn (2017)\
  a.	Bin data in space and time\
  b.	Normalize rws and SNR in each bin\
  c.	Remove bins without enough members\
  d.	Remove points with standard error outside the limit\
  e.	Calculate two-dimensional histogram of normalized rws and SNR\
  f.	Identify probability threshold where the dispersion increases above a prescribed amount\
  g.	Remove points below probability threshold\
  h.	Remove bins without enough remaining points\
8.	Re-index file with number of beams per scan and number of scans, to have dimensions of [range, beamID, scanID] based on scan type (i.e., PPI or RHI)
9.	Add attributes to variables explaining their meanings and units, along with global file attributes
10.	Make and save figures showing the quality and control procedure
